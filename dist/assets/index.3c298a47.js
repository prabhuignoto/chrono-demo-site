      This would be done by luring into a trap the US navy carriers that had escaped Pearl Harbor, while at the same time the Japanese would occupy the Midway atoll in preparation for further attacks. The loss of the carriers would, the Japanese hoped, force the Americans to the negotiating table. In the event, it was the Americans who inflicted a crushing defeat on the Japanese. Their codebreakers were able to determine the location and date of the Japanese attack. This enabled US admiral Chester Nimitz to organise a trap of his own.
      During the ensuing battle the Japanese suffered the loss of four carriers, one heavy cruiser and 248 aircraft, while American losses totalled one carrier, one destroyer and 98 planes. By their victory at Midway, the turning point of the Pacific war, the Americans were able to seize the strategic initiative from the Japanese, who had suffered irreplaceable losses.

      The British Middle East commander General Claude Auchinleck took personal command of the defending Eighth Army and halted the retreat at the strong defensive line at El Alamein. But Churchill, dissatisfied with Auchinleck, replaced him in August with General Harold Alexander, while Lieutenant -General Bernard Montgomery took over command of the Eighth Army.
      Montgomery immediately began to build up an enormous superiority in men and equipment, finally launching his offensive at Alamein on 23 October 1942. By the beginning of November, the Axis forces were in full retreat, although final victory in North Africa was not achieved until May 1943.

      Hitler, wrongly assured by G\xF6ring that the Luftwaffe could supply Stalingrad by air, ordered Paulus to hold out. He also ordered Field Marshal Erich Manstein to break through and relieve the beleaguered Sixth Army. Manstein was unsuccessful, and on 31 January 1943 Paulus capitulated. Of the 91,000 German troops who went into captivity, less than 6,000 returned home after the war.

The reason for attacking the city was due principally to its strategic importance as a communications centre in the rear of the German retreat that followed the Soviet winter offensive of January 1945. It was also believed that Dresden might be used as an alternative to Berlin as the Reich capital.
      The attack was part of a plan codenamed \u2018Thunderclap\u2019, designed to convince the Germans that the war was lost. It was drawn up in January 1945, when Hitler\u2019s Ardennes offensive, V2 rocket attacks on Britain and the deployment of snorkel-equipped U-boats clearly demonstrated that Germany was still capable of offering stubborn resistance. Strategic bombing attacks had previously failed to break Germany, although they had proved valuable in reducing its capacity to wage war.
      Now, on the night of 13/14 February 1945, Dresden was attacked by 800 RAF bombers, followed by 400 bombers of the United States Army Air Force. The bombing created a firestorm that destroyed 1,600 acres of Dresden. Even today it is still uncertain as to how many died and estimates have ranged from 25,000 to 135,000.

The loss of the carriers would, the Japanese hoped, force the Americans to the negotiating table. In the event, it was the Americans who inflicted a crushing defeat on the Japanese. Their codebreakers were able to determine the location and date of the Japanese attack. This enabled US admiral Chester Nimitz to organise a trap of his own.
      During the ensuing battle the Japanese suffered the loss of four carriers, one heavy cruiser and 248 aircraft, while American losses totalled one carrier, one destroyer and 98 planes. By their victory at Midway, the turning point of the Pacific war, the Americans were able to seize the strategic initiative from the Japanese, who had suffered irreplaceable losses. Admiral Nimitz described the battle\u2019s success as \u201CEssentially a victory of intelligence\u201D, while President Roosevelt called it \u201COur most important victory in 1942\u2026 there we stopped the Japanese offensive.\u201D`},{title:"25 October 1942",cardTitle:"Alamein",cardSubtitle:"German prisoners of war wait for transport after their capture at Alamein",media:{type:"IMAGE",source:{url:"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/08/11/49FEAE2A00000578-5477117-image-a-79_1520509429888.jpg"}},cardDetailedText:`The North African campaign began in September1940, and for the next two years the fighting was marked by a succession of Allied and Axis advances and retreats. In the summer of 1942, the Axis forces under \u2018Desert Fox\u2019 field marshal, Erwin Rommel, looked poised to take Cairo and advance on the Suez Canal.
      The British Middle East commander General Claude Auchinleck took personal command of the defending Eighth Army and halted the retreat at the strong defensive line at El Alamein. But Churchill, dissatisfied with Auchinleck, replaced him in August with General Harold Alexander, while Lieutenant -General Bernard Montgomery took over command of the Eighth Army.
      Montgomery immediately began to build up an enormous superiority in men and equipment, finally launching his offensive at Alamein on 23 October 1942. By the beginning of November, the Axis forces were in full retreat, although final victory in North Africa was not achieved until May 1943.
      Although Montgomery has been criticised for being too cautious in exploiting his success at Alamein, it made him a household name and he became Britain\u2019s most popular general of the war. Churchill hailed Alamein as a \u201CGlorious and decisive victory\u2026 the bright gleam has caught the helmets of our soldiers, and warmed and cheered all our hearts\u201D.`},{title:"February 1943",cardTitle:"Stalingrad",cardSubtitle:"Red Army soldiers hoist the Soviet flag over a recaptured Stalingrad factory following the German surrender",cardDetailedText:`Throughout September and October, under General Vassili Chuikov, the city\u2019s defenders contested every yard of ground of the devastated city.
      The Red Army\u2019s stubborn defence allowed General Georgi Zhukov time to prepare a counterattack that was launched on 19 November 1942, and which soon trapped the Sixth Army commanded by General Friederich Paulus.
      Hitler, wrongly assured by G\xF6ring that the Luftwaffe could supply Stalingrad by air, ordered Paulus to hold out. He also ordered Field Marshal Erich Manstein to break through and relieve the beleaguered Sixth Army. Manstein was unsuccessful, and on 31 January 1943 Paulus capitulated. Of the 91,000 German troops who went into captivity, less than 6,000 returned home after the war. Stalingrad was one of Germany\u2019s greatest defeats, and it effectively marked the end of Hitler\u2019s dreams of an empire in the east.

      That day, under the overall command of US General Dwight Eisenhower, British, Canadian and American troops, supported by the Allied navies and air forces, came ashore on the coast of Normandy. By the end of the day, 158,000 men, including airborne troops, had landed. Initially, except on the American Omaha beach, German resistance was unexpectedly light. But it soon stiffened and the Allied breakout from the beachhead area was painfully slow.
      The fierceness of the fighting can be gauged by the fact that in Normandy British infantry battalions were suffering the same percentage casualty rates as they had on the Western Front in 1914\u20131918. Eventually the breakout was achieved, and on 25 August, Paris was liberated. Brussels followed on 3 September. Hopes that the war might be won in 1944 were dashed by the Allied failure at Arnhem and the unexpected German offensive in the Ardennes in December.
      It was not until 4 May 1945 that the German forces in north-west Europe surrendered to Montgomery at his HQ on L\xFCneburg Heath.`},{title:"February 1945",cardTitle:"The Big Three",cardSubtitle:"Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin sit for a group photograph during the Yalta conference",cardDetailedText:`Between June 1940 and June 1941, Britain stood alone against Hitler. But then, after the German invasion of Russia and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, she gained two powerful allies.
      For the next four years Churchill did his utmost to foster \u2018The Grand Alliance\u2019 against the Nazis. He even earned the grudging admiration of Nazi propaganda chief Dr Goebbels who said, \u201C\u2026I can feel only respect for this man, for whom no humiliation is too base and no trouble too great when the victory of the Allies is at stake\u201D.
      Churchill conferred with both Roosevelt and Stalin to hammer out strategy and to discuss postwar arrangements. The three men congregated for the first time at Tehran in November 1943. There, and again at their last meeting at Yalta, Churchill was conscious of the fact that Britain, exhausted by her war effort, was now very much the junior partner of the two emerging superpowers.`},{title:"13/14 February 1945",cardTitle:"Dresden",cardSubtitle:"Dresden under incendiary bomb attack",cardDetailedText:`At Yalta, an Allied plan to bomb the hitherto untouched city of Dresden was discussed. The reason for attacking the city was due principally to its strategic importance as a communications centre in the rear of the German retreat that followed the Soviet winter offensive of January 1945. It was also believed that Dresden might be used as an alternative to Berlin as the Reich capital.
      The attack was part of a plan codenamed \u2018Thunderclap\u2019, designed to convince the Germans that the war was lost. It was drawn up in January 1945, when Hitler\u2019s Ardennes offensive, V2 rocket attacks on Britain and the deployment of snorkel-equipped U-boats clearly demonstrated that Germany was still capable of offering stubborn resistance. Strategic bombing attacks had previously failed to break Germany, although they had proved valuable in reducing its capacity to wage war.
      Now, on the night of 13/14 February 1945, Dresden was attacked by 800 RAF bombers, followed by 400 bombers of the United States Army Air Force. The bombing created a firestorm that destroyed 1,600 acres of Dresden. Even today it is still uncertain as to how many died and estimates have ranged from 25,000 to 135,000. Most authorities now put the death toll at around 35,000. The scale of destruction, the enormous death toll, and its timing at such a late stage in the war, have all ensured that the bombing of Dresden still remains highly controversial.`},{title:"8 May 1945",cardTitle:"VE Day",media:{type:"IMAGE",source:{url:"https://ic.c4assets.com/brands/ve-day-in-colour-britains-biggest-party/d708c2d9-8fec-4592-a90f-ddfe3513c914.jpg?interpolation=progressive-bicubic&output-quality=90"}},cardSubtitle:"millions of people rejoice in the news that Germany has surrendered \u2013 the war in Europe was finally over",cardDetailedText:`On the afternoon of 8 May 1945, the British prime minister Winston Churchill made the radio announcement that the world had long been waiting for.

      The Poles fought bravely, but they were heavily outnumbered in both men and machines, and especially in the air. Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939, but gave no real assistance to Poland. Two weeks later, Stalin invaded eastern Poland, and on 27 September Warsaw surrendered. Organised Polish resistance ceased after another week\u2019s fighting. Poland was divided up between Hitler and Stalin.
      In Poland the Nazis unleashed a reign of terror that was eventually to claim six million victims, half of whom were Polish Jews murdered in extermination camps. The Soviet regime was no less harsh. In March and April 1940, Stalin ordered the murder of over 20,000 Polish officers and others who had been captured in September 1939. Tens of thousands of Poles were also forcibly deported to Siberia.
      By May 1945, and despite his promises to Churchill and Roosevelt, Stalin had installed a subservient communist regime in Poland.
